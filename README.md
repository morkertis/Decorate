# Decorate
Decorate is an algorithm for creating diversity in ensembles by artificial training examples. 
This implementation generates synthetic data within two way:  
  1. using the article algorithm (Creating diversity in ensembles using artificial data)
  2. using Generative adversarial network(GAN)
