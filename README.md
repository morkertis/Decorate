# Decorate
Decorate is an algorithm for creating diversity in ensembles by artificial training examples. 
This implementation generates synthetic data within two way:  
  1. using the article algorithm ([Creating diversity in ensembles using artificial data](http://aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1190))
  2. using Generative adversarial network (GAN)
